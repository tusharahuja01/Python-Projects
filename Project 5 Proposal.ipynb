    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Indian stock market, a vital component of the nation's economic landscape, reflects the pulse of economic activity, investment sentiment, and business outlook. With millions of investors participating in trading activities daily, understanding the dynamics of the stock market is crucial for making informed investment decisions and driving economic growth. In recent years, the availability of real-time data and advances in technology have revolutionized the way investors analyze market trends and identify investment opportunities. However, bridging the gap between real-time market movements and historical trends remains a challenge. This project aims to explore the relationship between real-time and historical stock market data in the context of the Indian market, shedding light on how investors can leverage past and current information to predict stock market trends and make more informed decisions for the future.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**About NIFTY 50:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The NIFTY 50 index, comprising 50 of India's largest and most liquid companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), serves as a benchmark for the Indian equity market. Calculated using the free-float market capitalization method, it accurately reflects the market value of constituent stocks, ensuring representation across various sectors and minimizing institutional bias."
